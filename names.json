She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a 'computing machine' and the first computer programmer."},

She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today."},
